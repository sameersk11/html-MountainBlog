            <p id="cardDescription">Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love mountains. After going<br>
                 on one of these tours, I can safely say that they are my favorite geographic feature, <br>
                 and my favorite word that starts with M.</p>

            <p id="cardDescription">
                I never understood why people cared so much about mountains. But then I went<br>
                 on one of these tours. Now I can't understand<br>
                  people who don't care about mountains!
